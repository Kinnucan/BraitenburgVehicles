# BasicBot-Code
Code for controlling the EV3 robot as built for this class

The basicBot.py file has a definition of a robot controller class. This gives a higher-level interface for working with motors and sensors on the robot. The ev3dev commands are necessarily low level, since you can build many different robots with Lego parts. This class defines commands specific to this build.

The testRobot.py file contains tester code to test different aspects of the robot, and to illustrate how to create and use the robot controller class.
